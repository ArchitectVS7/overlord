```

**OR** copy-paste from:
```
📁 git-commands.txt
```

---

### 2. Read Quick Start (After commit - 2 minutes)

Open:
```
📁 Overlord.Phaser\tests\e2e\QUICK-START.md
```

---

### 3. Run Tests (10 minutes)

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd C:\dev\GIT\Overlord\Overlord.Phaser
npm run start

# Terminal 2 (new terminal)

## 🎯 What Happens When You Run Tests

```
Browser opens automatically →
Navigates to http://localhost:8080 →
Game loads →
Tests explore every scene →
Find all buttons and text →
Try clicking everything →
Take screenshots of everything →
Create detailed logs →
Generate HTML report →
✅ COMPLETE!
```

**Output:**
- 📸 Screenshots in `test-results/`
- 📊 HTML report (view with `npx playwright show-report`)
- 📝 Detailed console logs

## 📊 What You're About to Learn

After running tests, you'll know:

✅ **Every scene in your game**
- MainMenuScene
- GalaxyMapScene
- CampaignConfigScene
- etc.

✅ **Every button and text element**
- "NEW CAMPAIGN" at (400, 200)
- "FLASH CONFLICTS" at (400, 250)
- etc.

✅ **What's clickable and what's not**
- Which buttons have handlers
- Which regions respond to clicks
- Which keyboard shortcuts work

✅ **How scenes connect**
- Main Menu → Campaign Config → Galaxy Map
- Main Menu → Flash Conflicts → Tutorial
- etc.

✅ **What works and what needs fixing**
- ✅ Tests that pass = working features
- ❌ Tests that fail = issues to fix
- ⚠️ Warnings = areas needing attention

## 🎯 Success Metrics

You'll know it worked when:

✅ **Commit succeeds**
- Git log shows your commit
- Remote repository updated
- No errors

✅ **Tests run**
- Browser opens automatically
- Game loads in browser
- Tests execute (passes or failures - both OK!)
- Screenshots created

✅ **Results are clear**
- Console shows discoveries
- HTML report accessible
- Test results make sense

**Any of these = SUCCESS!** Remember, we're discovering reality, not judging it.

---

## 🚨 Important Reminders

1. **Tests will find issues** - That's GOOD! That's the point!
2. **Some tests may fail** - Expected! We're discovering what exists
3. **Screenshots are key** - They show exactly what tests saw
4. **Discovery takes time** - Let tests run ~5 minutes
5. **Headed mode is valuable** - Watch what tests do
