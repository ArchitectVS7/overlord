# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Venomous
**Date:** 2025-12-08

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Finding a game engine with direct Claude Code integration (API/CLI/MCP/automation) that's cross-platform and doesn't require manual Unity-style workflows

**Goals:**
- Identify engines Claude Code can DIRECTLY control/interact with
- Cross-platform capability (desktop, mobile, web)
- Preserve Overlord.Core (.NET Standard 2.1) investment
- Get you BUILDING instead of debugging integration hell
- Flexible for community/open source/commercial release options

### Session Setup

**Context:** After 3 days of Unity integration problems (manual workflows, no orchestration, constant errors), need to pivot to an engine that Claude Code can directly control. Current asset: solid Overlord.Core platform-agnostic library. Future flexibility needed for community re-release vs commercial vs open source decisions.

**Direct Integration Candidates Identified:**
- ✅ Godot (CLI, text scenes, C# support)
- ✅ MonoGame/FNA (pure C#, no editor)
- ✅ Web engines (Phaser, Three.js, PixiJS with Playwright)
- ✅ Bevy (Rust, pure code, ECS)
- ✅ Love2D (Lua, text configs)

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Replace Unity with engine offering direct Claude Code integration, cross-platform support, and .NET Core preservation

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Decision Tree Mapping** (structured, 15-20 min): Map all possible decision paths and cascading outcomes for each engine option. Reveals hidden opportunities and risks. Chosen because multiple engine options exist with complex trade-offs requiring systematic visualization.

2. **Solution Matrix** (structured, 20-25 min): Create systematic grid of requirements vs engine options with scoring. Eliminates emotional decision-making through data-driven comparison. Builds on decision tree by quantifying which paths score highest on actual priorities.

3. **Constraint Mapping** (deep, 10-15 min): Identify which constraints are REAL vs IMAGINED to prevent false limitations from blocking good solutions. Completes sequence by revealing whether assumed constraints (e.g., "must preserve all .NET investment") are actually flexible.

**AI Rationale:** Session context indicates high time pressure (3 days already wasted), frustration with manual workflows, and need for concrete technical decision fast. Structured techniques provide systematic evaluation framework preventing rushed decisions while maintaining efficiency. Total 45-60 minute flow designed for confident, defensible outcome.
