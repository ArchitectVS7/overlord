# Archived Design Documents

These documents are historical artifacts from early project phases. They have been archived because the project has progressed significantly beyond their scope.

**Archived on:** 2025-12-16

## Why These Were Archived

### PROJECT-ROADMAP-pre-implementation.md
Original roadmap created before implementation began. Described Phase 1-3 work as "to do" but Epics 1-11 (except 8, 10) are now complete.

### PROJECT-ROADMAP-V2-sprint-planning.md
Detailed sprint-level planning for Epics 6, 7, 1, 8, 9. All except Epic 8 are now complete. The sprint planning is historical reference only.

### bmm-workflow-status.yaml
Tracked BMAD Methodology workflow progress. Shows "implementation-readiness" as next step, but implementation is 75% complete with 1,272 passing tests.
